                <p>Like most website operators, Oraganic store collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Oraganic store's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Oraganic store's visitors use its website. From time to time, Oraganic store may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                <p>Oraganic store also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://organicstore.com blog posts. Oraganic store only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
